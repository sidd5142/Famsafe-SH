## Problem Statement

- Communication Breakdowns: Difficulty reaching family members promptly during emergencies due to communication issues.
- Limited Support Network: Difficulty mobilizing nearby contacts or friends for assistance in emergencies.
- Uncertainty during Travel: Anxiety and uncertainty among family members regarding the safety of traveling loved ones.
- Concerns about Inactivity: Worry about the well-being of unresponsive family members during extended periods.

## Solution
- Phone Inactivity Alarms: Our system diligently monitors phone activity, promptly detecting extended periods of inactivity. Upon detection, it triggers a ringing alert to prompt the user to confirm their status. If no response is received, designated family members are automatically notified, ensuring timely awareness of the situation.
- SOS Messages: Our feature empowers users to send urgent SOS messages during emergencies, selecting predefined messages for quick notification to family or trusted contacts. These messages include the user's real-time location, ensuring swift assistance when needed.
- Emergency Contacts within Radius: Our system automatically alerts the user's family if they become unreachable, ensuring prompt awareness during emergencies. Additionally, it facilitates the sharing of nearby contacts for local assistance, enhancing the efficiency of emergency responses. Even if the user is unreachable, swift assistance is enabled, ensuring rapid mobilization of help in critical situations.
- Last Location Activity: The system records recent location data for user reference and offers analysis of movements and behavior. If needed, it aids in retracing steps, facilitating recall of past locations or activities.
